# Birdsong Recognition
> The idea for this projec is to build a small webapp so that one can record bird songs/calls on the phone and have a trained model predict what bird it is. I'm hoping to use this to get quick feedback as I learn more about bird calls in my neighbourhood.


> I'm also trying out nbdev to see how useful it can be.
